**Conda** is an efficient package management tool that allows users 
to install all required packages with a single command, simply by specifying what they need.
Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success),
though I personally recommend [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).<br/>
In this blog, there are **3** main parts:
- Quick guide to creating an environment with Conda (online)
- Switching to a different Conda source (mirror)
- Creating an environment with Conda offline
